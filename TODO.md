# To Do List

## Requirements
- [ ] As a user I can visualise images retrieved via public URLâ€™s in a gallery page.
- [ ] As a user I can filter images based on their content (i.e. people, plants, chairs, windows etc).
- [ ] As a user I can select one of the images and blur parts of this image (i.e a persons face) and
download the edited image.

## Structure
- [ ] Set up React components for this Project
    The main components you want to focus on will be...
    - [x] Header (Will only contain the title of the project)
    - [x] SearchForm (Will consist of an input and a button)
    - [x] ImageList
    - [x] Image

## Design
- [ ] Set up SCSS work environment for styling
    - [ ] Install node-sass
    - [ ] Set up project folders
    - [ ] Style Header
    - [ ] Style ImageList
    - [ ] Style base elements

### Design considerations
 - What's your MVP? Viewing and searching for images.
 - The design should look professional and complement the design style that HELIX RE are using currently.
 - The application should be as simple and easy to use as possible to use, so try to keep the features to a minimum.
